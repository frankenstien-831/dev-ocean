# Squid API
```
name: Squid API Specification
shortname: squid-spec
version: 0.5
status: Draft
date: January 2020
```

The Squid API is a Level-2 API built on top of core Ocean components. It's a facilitator or enabler, but it's not the only way to interact with Ocean.

- [squid-js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-js)
- [squid-py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-py)
- [squid-java](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-java)

The goal of this doc is to help a developer build a version of the Squid API in any programming language. Currently, the Squid API is defined for Object-Oriented languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Python (which are the three initial implementation languages).

## Ocean

This is the main class to interact with the Ocean network. 

All ocean protocol features are accessed through this module.

---

## ocean.assets

#### create

High-level method publishing the metadata off-chain and registering the Service Agreement on-chain. It creates a 
DID Document (DDO) that represent the registered asset.

Parameters
```
        metadata: JSON object describing various attributes of the asset data (see below for sample metadata attributes)
publisherAccount: Account instance of who is publishing the asset
        services: list of Service instances (optional)
        accountOwner: If is specified, the ownership of the DID will be assigned to this ethereum account (optional)
```

Returns

`Asset object (encapsulates the DDO document)`

Example
```js
const metadata = {
  "assetId": "0x123412341234",
  "publisherId": "0x00000000000",
  "base":{
    "name": "name",
    "size": "5gb",
    "author": "someone",
    "license": "public domain",
    "contentType": '',
    "files": ["/url/dataset-name"],
  }
}

const asset = ocean.assets.create(metadata, publisherAccount, services=[ocean.services.createAccessSecretStoreService(...)], accountOwner)
```

The complete spec for assets metadata is here: [Asset Metadata Ontology](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/8)
 
---

#### resolve

Given a DID, return the associated DID Document (DDO). The DDO is resolved by directly 
interacting with the keeper node to retrieve the metadata store's (Aquarius) URL. This URL is 
used to fetch the DDO from the off-chain ocean-db storage (mongodb, bigchain-db, or whatever)

Parameters
```
did: str the asset did which consist of `did:op:` and the assetId hex str (without `0x` prefix)
```

Returns

`Asset object`

Example
```js
const asset = ocean.assets.resolve(did)
```

---

#### transfer ownership

Given a DID, transfer the ownership to a new owner. This function only will work if is called by the DID owner.

Parameters
```
did: str the asset did which consist of `did:op:` and the assetId hex str (without `0x` prefix)
newOwner: the ethereum address of the new owner of the DID
```

Returns

`boolean specifying if the operation was executed successfully`

Example
```js
const result= ocean.assets.transferOwnership(did, newOwner)
```

---

#### search

Given a search text query, returns a list of the Asset objects matching with that text query.

Parameters
```
text: str the text to search on
```

Returns

`list of Asset instances that match the search text`


Example
```js
const assets = ocean.assets.search('office')
```

---

#### query

Search existing registered assets using more fine tuned method. Supports paging, 
sorting and search on specific metadata attributes. 

Parameters
```
searchQuery: JSON object 
```
 ```json
{
  "offset": 100,
  "page": 0,
  "query": {
    "value": 1
  },
  "sort": {
    "value": 1
  }
}
 ```

Returns

`list of Asset instances that match the search query`
 
Example
```js
const searchQuery = {"query": {"value": 1}}
const assets = ocean.assets.query(searchQuery)
```

---

#### order

Start the purchase/order of an asset's service. Starts by signing the service 
agreement then sends the request to the publisher via the service endpoint (Brizo http service)

Parameters
```
                did: str the asset did which consist of `did:op:` and the assetId hex str (without `0x` prefix)
serviceDefinitionId: str id of the service within the asset DDO
    consumerAccount: Account instance of the consumer ordering the service
```

Returns

`agreementId (can be used to query the keeper regarding the order)`

Example
```js
const agreementId = ocean.assets.order(did, serviceDefinitionId, consumerAccount)
```

---

#### consume
Downloads all files associated with the asset unless `index` is specified which will 
download only that one data file.

Parameters
```
        agreementId: hex str representation of `bytes32` id
                did: str the asset did which consist of `did:op:` and the assetId hex str (without `0x` prefix)
serviceDefinitionId: str id of the service within the asset DDO
    consumerAccount: Account instance of the consumer ordering the service
         resultPath: (optional) str path to store the downloaded files or results of a compute operation
         index: (optional) int index of specific file to download. The index 
            corresponds to the index in the `files` list in the DDO document.
```

Returns

`str local path on the file system where the asset data files are downloaded` 

Example
```js
const downloadsPath = ocean.assets.consume(agreementId, did, serviceDefinitionId, consumerAccount, resultPath)
```

---

#### validate

Validate the integrity of an asset after consuming. This is achieved by regenerating 
the checksum of the ddo document and comparing to the registered checksum that was 
generated at time of publishing the asset. 

Parameters
